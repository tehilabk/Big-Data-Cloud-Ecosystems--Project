â€¢ The system enable viewing the characteristics of packages that are on their way to Israel: the display is organized in a district section, and shows a number
Packages along the way and you can also request a graph showing the size distribution and tax billing nature of a particular district.
We built a simulator that simulates a tracking shipments with details of Packages that send to an address in a particular district,
such as: tracking Number, list of items, size (small, large, medium), tax charge etc ..

â€¢ The simulator simulates scanning packages before sending them to Israel and will update their departure via message. To simulate arrival the simulator will generate
Randomly a QRCODE sticker that will be stored in a cloud storage service.

In the dashboard we will display the information taken from the Redis that run on the Docker.

The data from MongoDB will be taken and saved in a csv file that will be sent to bigML which we will use to create a learning model which will give us the prediction of support and confidence of all items.
